## Hi there, I'm Aldhair 👽

### 👨‍💻 About Me
Self-taught javascript developer focused on learning new technologies and building web applications.

### 💻Now
- 🌱 Currently learning *ReactjS*, *NodejS* and building websites to improve my *CSS* and *JavaScript* code.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on **Frontendmentor** challenges and following the javascript certification in **FreeCodeCamp**.
- 🔨 I recently finished my first **FullStack project**, It's a simple [Todo-List](https://evening-scrubland-30594.herokuapp.com/) with a database (MongoDB) and deployed to heroku.
